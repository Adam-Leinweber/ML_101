<<<<<<< HEAD
The following packages are required for this presentation:
Python3
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow
sklearn
Jupyter Notebook (OPTIONAL)

gaussian_NN.ipynb contains the solution to the first half of the presentation in which we will tackle a simple classification problem. Together we will generate a dataset, build a very simple neural network, train that network and briefly analyse the results.

mnist_convnet.ipynb contains a more realistic classification problem. In this example we will aim to create an algorithm which can quickly and accurately identify handwritten digits using the mnist handwritten digit dataset. We will go through the same steps as before, importing the dataset, building the neural network, training and analysing.
