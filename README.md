gaussian_NN.ipynb contains the solution to the first half of the presentation in which we will tackle a simple classification problem. Together we will generate a dataset, build a very simple neural network, train that network and finally, briefly analyse the results.

mnist_convnet.ipynb contains a more realistic classification problem. This example uses the mnist handwritten digit dataset and we will create an algorithm which can quickly and accurately identify each digit. We will go through the same steps as before, importing the dataset, building the neural network, training and analysing.
